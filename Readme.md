---This is a Data cleaning project in SQL Server Management Studio---

Special Credit goes to Alex freigberg-The owner of Alex the Analyst channel in youtube for showing what codes to be written for each desired output which I have followed along the way and learn what code to be written for each output for such dataset in the future projects.

The dataset contains Housing data for Nashville Housing Society where numerous columns had data that needed to be organised and cleaned up to make the dataset much usable and  understandable and easy to analyze.

The major SQL functions used for the cleaning purposes are: CONVERT,SUBSTRING,CHARINDEX,SELF JOIN,ISNULL,PARSENAME,CASE,CTE

The project map has been described in the Wiki section with the screenshot of data output before and after each SQL query-showing up the output in SQL server management studio from the queries used to do data cleaning.

Complete codes can be found in the file section.

Thank You!
